# 100 Days Of Code - Log

 Day 1: January 4 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamps random quote machine.

**Thoughts:** I've done something similar with jQuery and getJSON() with a movie poster app but I wanted to try this using vanilla JS and use XMLHttpRequest, took a lot longer that I thought it would. Spent a long time realizing that the API I was trying to use wasn't set up for me to include the API key in the URL as a parameter. Only can be set in the header. That led me to some google-fu and came across XMLHttpRequest, and looked through the docs. Nothing to show so far, just have the call returning a random movie quote. Next is to save it to a variable or array or something.

 Day 2: January 5 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamps random quote machine.

**Thoughts:** Made more progress on this today, I now have an array of responses from an API call. Tomorrow I'll work on getting them to display on the page.

 Day 3: January 6 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamps random quote machine. Added some css animations

**Thoughts:** Made more progress on this today, but my head wasn't in it. I was able to add a loading animation to play while the request goes out, yes it's not async but that's a bug for another day,
added a fade in div for the container of the quote machine, tomrrow will start hooking things up to the data.

 Day 5: January 8 2017

**Today's Progress**: Huge progress today, Practically done, got colors changing on click and a tweet functionality added!!, refactored code to make more clean and readable.

**Thoughts:** Today was amazing, flew though the challenges and had some bugs but they were really easy to kill!!
I'll look into deploying this to a github page.

 Day 7: January 10  2017

**Today's Progress**: started on FCC weather API

**Thoughts:** I thought this would be kind of easy to start off, just coming off a similar project using an API for the quotes. I used the same pattern and techniques that worked for me with the quote machine, but something's not quite right. It's not parseing correctly. Only getting [object, object] to appear. I think I'm displaying the response object from the fetch call and not the response itself. ugh

 Day 8: January 11 2017

**Today's Progress**: Data is being stored in App object from weather API, good start.

**Thoughts:** Turns out was just too tired yesterday, the same pattern applies here as the RQM. The mistake I made was I was trying to display the coords object in the dom, and couldn't figure out why is was displaying object object, well it's because the coords object on the response is an object, yup that would do it.

 Day 9: January 12 2017

**Today's Progress**: Most functionality is there, just need to have icons change based on the weather. Should be interesting. 

**Thoughts:** This project has been fun so far, I'm really liking messing with APIs. I like how they all seem to follow a pattern of get the data, save the data somewhere, then you can mess with it all you want, assuming you just need to make one call to it.

 Day 10: January 13 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished FCC weatherAPI, was pretty fun.

**Thoughts:** Will take a break from APIs next, I'll work on some wes bos stuff.

 Day 11: January 14 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring Movie Poster API

**Thoughts:** This is much harder than starting from scratch, I've gotten alo better at coding since then but still, i see what I did and it's a challenge to get that out of my head and come up with a more elegant solution. Still i think it's an important exercise in problem solving and coding. In the real world you'll be working on other peoples code so I better get used to it. Haha i'm in trouble if I can't under stand my own.

 Day 13: January 16 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring Movie Poster API

**Thoughts:** I'm almost done but haveing trouble coming up with the last solution, without copying and pasting practically the same function.

 Day 14: January 17 2017

**Today's Progress** Finished refactoring Movie Poster API reduced 80 lines to 50.

**Thoughts:** Nice feeling finishing this, surprised how long it took to refactor, longer than it took me to code in the first place
